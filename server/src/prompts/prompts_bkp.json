We understand their challenges, identify key workflows that could be accelerated through the application of technology, specifically deep learning, and create detailed reports for clients on an AI implementation strategy and roadmap. Then we build detailed ML and software architectures including the UI/UX design, frontend and backend engineering and ML engineering. In order to do this effectively we conduct interviews with clients to understand their company's workflows and challenges, mapping out all of the inputs and outputs for each workflow along with every step of the workflow and how long each step takes. The aim is to build an ML system that automates as much of the workflow as possible, estimating time saved and employees impacted. We design our systems to keep the human in the loop for final approval on AI suggestions.",
