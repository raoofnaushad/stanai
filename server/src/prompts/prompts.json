In order to do this effectively we conduct interviews with clients to understand their company's workflows and challenges, mapping out all of the inputs and outputs for each workflow along with every step of the workflow and how long each step takes. The aim is to build an ML system that automates as much of the workflow as possible, estimating time saved and employees impacted.
